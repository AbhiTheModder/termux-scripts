Some termux scripts created by me for easier Installation of tools 

# Contents

5. **tgpatcher.py:** Patch script for applying patches to Telegram

This repo also hosts the github workflow to automate this script and for version checking it stores old version into file named `backup_tg_version.txt`.
> [!TIP]
> First decompile your apk using apktool or APKEditor.

6. **tgupload.py:** Simple script made to upload files from local dir to telegram chat, also used in this repo scheduled actions to upload patched apk(s) generated by it to telegram thus avoiding abuse of github releases and bypassing BOT upload limit of 50MB (of usual telegram upload actions artifacts).
